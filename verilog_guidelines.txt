Important Coding Guidelines with Nonblocking Assignments
--------------------------------------------------------

From Clifford E. Cummings paper: Verilog Nonblocking Assignments With Delays,
Myths & Mysteries.

Guideline #1: When modeling sequential logic, use nonblocking assignments.

Guideline #2: When modeling latches, use nonblocking assignments.

Guideline #3: When modeling combinational logic with an always block, use blocking
assignments.

Guideline #4: When modeling both sequential and combinational logic within the same always
block, use nonblocking assignments.

Guideline #5: Do not mix blocking and nonblocking assignments in the same always block.

Guideline #6: Do not make assignments to the same variable from more than one always block.

Guideline #7: Use $strobe to display values that have been assigned using nonblocking
assignments.

Guideline #8: Do not make assignments using #0 delays.
